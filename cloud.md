# Cloud

The term "cloud" originates from the use of cloud-shaped symbols in network diagrams to represent the internet.

The cloud isÂ a network of remote servers around the world that store and manage data, run applications, and deliver services over the internet.

# Cloud computing

Cloud computing, on the other hand, is the delivery of computing services over the internet, using resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more, provided by cloud service providers. Cloud computing allows users to access and utilize these resources on-demand, without the need for owning or maintaining physical infrastructure.
