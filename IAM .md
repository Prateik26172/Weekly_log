Identity Access Management

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is **a web service that allows users to control access to AWS services**. IAM is a feature of an AWS account and is available at no additional cost. IAM allows users to specify who can access which AWS resources and services, and under what conditions. IAM also allows users to centrally manage permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS
